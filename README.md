ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools to manage crypto coins.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how blockchain technology works.

- ğŸ˜„ My preferred programming languages are BASH and Python. I use other programming languages if they offer a faster or better solution.

- ğŸ‘‹ I started my current work with tools for Tezos. This was driven by problems with importing private keys, which is now a solved issue.
