🌱 I’m currently learning how blockchain technology works.

- <p align="justify">💾 My preferred programming languages are BASH and Python. I use other programming languages if they offer a faster or better solution.</p>

- <p align="justify">💾 I started my current work with tools for Tezos. This was driven by problems with importing private keys, which is now a solved issue.</p>

<p align="justify">My tools should help myself and ideally others. I would like to spare others the work I had to do to develop the necessary basics.</p>

<p align="justify">All scripts I am presenting are for private use by myself. A commercialization is not intended. Certain variables or constants are to be adapted partly in the scripts, since an input possibility makes only then sense, if inputs have often to be changed. I leave an adjustment to the interested user.</p>

<p align="justify">Last but not least I try to figure out how GitHub works and can be used.<p>
